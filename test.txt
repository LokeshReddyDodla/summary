This is a test document for the summarization service.

The purpose of this document is to test the file upload and processing functionality of the FastAPI application.

The application should be able to:
1. Accept file uploads via HTTP POST requests
2. Extract text from various file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
3. Process and chunk the text appropriately
4. Generate summaries using OpenAI's GPT models
5. Return the summary along with a download token

This test document contains multiple paragraphs and should provide enough content for the summarization algorithm to work with.

The system uses chunking to handle large documents by breaking them into smaller pieces, summarizing each chunk, and then combining the summaries into a final coherent report.

Environment variables are loaded from a .env file using python-dotenv, and the OpenAI API key must be properly configured for the service to function.

The FastAPI application includes CORS middleware to allow cross-origin requests, and serves static files for the frontend interface.
